# Multibreaker - A Minetest Mod #

**Multibreaker** is a simple mod created for  the Minetest engine, with the objective of minimizing repetitive tasks, 
like chopping dozens of blocks of wood, or digging dozens of blocks of minerals. This mod also allow cutting down full 
trees, so no floating stump will be left in the air, when the player is out of its reach to cut it down manually.

#Instructions#

It's possible to configure the mod in a way that a **multibreaking** action:

  - To expend (or not) the durability of a tool;
  - To be activated only with a given set of tool;
  - To be activated only with a specific key pressed;
  - To **multibreak** a given max number of blocks per interaction.
 
 This mod was build by *marco-vito* as a way to learn Lua language, and by *stealthio* as a way to get back to modding in Minetest.
